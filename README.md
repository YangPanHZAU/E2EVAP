# E2EVAP

This is official pytorch code base for [E2EVAP: End-to-end vectorization of smallholder agricultural parcel boundaries from high-resolution remote sensing imagery](ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing)

## introduction
This paper proposed a new end-to-end vectorization framework of smallholder agricultural parcel boundaries from high-resolution remote sensing imagerys.

![introduction](imgs/Fig.2.jpg)
The architecture of E2EVAP, where the key components include the contour initialization detector, hierarchical instance representation, vertex shift correction, and finally overall training of the network through multi-task loss optimization. 

## Using the code
The E2EvAP is being prepared for publication, and we will make source code available for reproducibiliy and benchmarking purposes here as soon as possible.
